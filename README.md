* The system will be able to read illegible handwriting of doctor's prescription to patients. ***Extract all information present in the image in text format. Deep learning model is needed to be develped using kaggle datasets of doctor's presciption jpg,png files.***
* After getting the text data, another model (***NLP model to analyze sentimental values to store the needed texts in a database in a structured way***)

  This are the initial tasks. If the output becomes useful then the project will expand in hospitals and pharmacies country wide.
